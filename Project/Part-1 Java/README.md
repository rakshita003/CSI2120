description: RANSAC algorithm to find the best fitting plane in a set of points using Java


This archive contains this file (ReadMe), Point3D.java, Plane3D.java,
PointCloud.java, PlaneRANSAC.java and MyIterator.java as the main
java file containing the code. There are the data files
PointCloud1.xyz, PointCloud2.xyz and PointColid3.xyz and the 3 png
file from which the data points are collected.

Instructions to run the code:

Compile PlaneRANSAC.java and run it with the arguments filename,
epsilon, confidence level, percentage of points on plane
Outputs a .xyz file with the name of the file run with the number of
iternations.xyz
