# RANSAC Algorithm for Plane Fitting in Point Cloud Data in JAVA

This repository contains a Scheme implementation of the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm for fitting a plane in a point cloud data. The RANSAC algorithm is used to estimate the parameters of a plane model that best fits a set of points contaminated with outliers.

- Student ID: 300215340
- Date: 31/01/2023
- Course: CSI 2120 Project - Part 3

## How to Run
Compile PlaneRANSAC.java and run it with the arguments filename,
epsilon, confidence level, percentage of points on plane
Outputs a .xyz file with the name of the file run with the number of
iternations.xyz

This archive contains this file (ReadMe), Point3D.java, Plane3D.java,
PointCloud.java, PlaneRANSAC.java and MyIterator.java as the main
java file containing the code. There are the data files
PointCloud1.xyz, PointCloud2.xyz and PointColid3.xyz and the 3 png
file from which the data points are collected.
